# 🏡 House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting house prices based on historical housing data by applying **Machine Learning** techniques. It utilizes libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Scikit-learn** for data processing, analysis, and modeling.

## 📌 **Project Objective**

To develop a predictive model capable of estimating the **price of a house** based on features such as:

- Number of bedrooms  
- Built area (square footage)  
- Location  
- And other relevant attributes

---

## 🛠️ **Technologies and Tools**

- **Python 3.x**  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis  
- **NumPy** – Mathematical and vector operations  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models and preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib** / **Seaborn** – Data visualization  

---

## 🧠 **Methodology**

### 1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**
- Importing the dataset
- Handling missing, null, or inconsistent values

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Statistical summaries of the dataset
- Visualizations to identify trends and outliers
- Analyzing correlations between features

### 3. **Data Preprocessing**
- **Feature scaling / normalization**  
- **Encoding categorical variables**  
- Splitting into features (X) and target variable (y)

### 4. **Train-Test Split**
- Dividing the data into training and testing sets.

### 5. **Model Building**
Implemented models include:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**

### 6. **Model Evaluation**
Evaluated using performance metrics such as:
- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)  
- **MSE** (Mean Squared Error)  
- **R² Score** (Coefficient of Determination)
